# RespiMotionSimulator
This respiratory organ motion simulator is to support proof-of-concept studies of MR monitoring approaches with respiration-induced organ motion.
The simulator consists of two main parts: 1) Motion actuator located outside the MRI scanner; 2) Motion phantom placed inside the MRI scanner.
These can be easily replicated based on open-source 3D models here and instructions.
Mechanisms of the simulator are described in User Manual as the following:
